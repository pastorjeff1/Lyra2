LM Studio with a compatible LLM (tested with Gemma3 17GB)
Python 3.9+ (installation instructions vary by Python version)
4090

Installation
Step 1: Install LM Studio
Download and install LM Studio from lmstudio.ai
Step 2: Download a Model
Using LM Studio's model library, download a model like Gemma3 (17GB)
Step 3: Install Python Dependencies
For Python 3.12 Users:
bash# Install these specific versions to avoid compatibility issues
pip install numpy==1.26.3
pip install scikit-learn==1.3.2
pip install torch==2.3.0 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
pip install sentence-transformers==2.3.1
pip install requests==2.31.0
For Python 3.9-3.11 Users:
bashpip install numpy scikit-learn requests
pip install sentence-transformers
pip install torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118  # For GPU support
Step 4: Prepare Directory Structure
Lyra2 expects to store memory files in C:\AI_Companion\Lyra2\. You can change this by modifying the MEMORY_DIR variable in the script.
Usage

Start LM Studio
Load your preferred model (e.g., Gemma3)
Start the LM Studio API server (usually on port 1234)
Run Lyra2:
python talk_with_lyra_2.py


Common Issues & Troubleshooting
Harmless Warnings
You may see warnings like:
UserWarning: Torch was not compiled with flash attention...
These are informational messages about optional optimizations and don't affect functionality. You can safely ignore them.
Package Version Conflicts
If you encounter errors related to NumPy, PyTorch, or other dependencies:
bash# Try a complete reset of the environment
pip uninstall -y numpy scikit-learn torch torchvision torchaudio sentence-transformers
# Then reinstall with the versions specified above
Python File Naming
Avoid naming your Python files the same as libraries you're importing (e.g., don't create files named torch.py, numpy.py, etc.).
Memory Directory Issues
If you encounter file permission errors:

Ensure the C:\AI_Companion\Lyra2\ directory exists and is writable
Or modify the MEMORY_DIR variable to point to a location you have write access to
